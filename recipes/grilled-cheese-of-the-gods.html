         <h4>Scientifically Proven Perfect Extremely Easy Grilled Cheese</h4>
          <p>Forget about calories! This is comfort food.</p>
          <p>Breakfast. Lunch. Dinner.</p>
          <p>Even cheap toast bread will Become Tasty, but if you have Nice Bread, it will make a difference.</p>
          <p>Same goes for cheese. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be expensive. But: have at least two different kinds. Crumbly, melty, salty. Brie, Camembert: wrong, too similar. Gouda, Cheddar: yes. Gouda, Cheddar, Feta: yes! Cheddar, Parmesan, Blue Cheese: HELL yes. Varying textures and tastes is what you need.</p>
          <p>Add some chili flakes or anything hot, trust me. Even if you hate it. Just a  symbolic pinch at least. Same goes for mustard or honey. NOBODY hates mustard more than me. Use a little bit of the one you hate less. </p>

           <p></p>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
         <p></p>
           <ol>
             <li>Put a pan on the stove, low-medium heat (2/10)</li>
             <li>Crush garlic with the flat of your knife, cut roughly</li>
             <li>Put garlic, butter, heat!ingredient and herbs in the pan</li>
             <li>Put slice 1 on top of your garlic/herb mix in the pan, turn up the heat to medium (5/10)</li>
             <li>Put honey (or mustard, ew) on slice 2</li>
             <li>Turn over slice 1. Put your cheeses on the grilled side of the slice, make sure most of the garlic/herb bits are under the cheese and not lost burning in the pan. Put slice 2 on top, honey on top of cheese. (Or mustard. I guess.) </li>
             <li>After a few minutes, <em>vibe check</em>. If your cheese is melting, and you can safely flip the grilled cheese sandwich, do. Or wait a few more minutes.</li>
             <li>Once the second side is grilled, eat.</li>
            </ol>
         <p>Bonus actions: tea, coffee. Add an egg to the pan once your grilled cheese is assembled, salt it, then put it sunny side down on your ready grilled cheese, stab it with fork. Let the yolk join the cheese. You can also add chutney, or avocado, if you fancy.</p>
         <p>EAT. Rejoice.</p>
