&lt;small&gt; tag for image captions. figcaption is for later
To do: 

Quotes in Readme caused by Tab? idk
check if lemon recipe edited on mobile turned out ok
sync issues between acode and github due to time sync stuff. save local j try again

Iteration 4: add more recipes

Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.
